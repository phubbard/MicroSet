This is a Python driver/interface for the MicroSet Watch Timing machine - 

http://www.bmumford.com/mset/modelwatch1.html

The goal of this project is to create an open-source interface to save, plot
and perhaps analyze MicroSet data.

Current status:
* Code started 6/5/2010
* Serial cable build and verified 6/5/2010 - http://watchotaku.com/display/swr/2010/07/06/Microset+serial+cable+build
* Did see some data in a serial terminal, and from that and email with Bryan Mumford
  I have a pretty good idea of how to start writing code.

Next steps and ideas:
* Use vuesz to generate live plots
* Log data to disk
